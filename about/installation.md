MPlusA was initially created in Python 3.11 and was developed to be independent from any operating
system specifics. It is believed that the library would work for previous versions of Python3 but
it was not tested.

To install MPlusA in yur Python virtual environment use pip:

```$ pip install mplusa```

The only dependency the library uses is [NumPy](https://numpy.org).
