The function for sorting the line segments. Because the line segments in tropical geometry have limited slopes and are always convex, the closest point (in Euclidean sense) is the next point in order for a given starting point.

Parameters
: `points : list`: the list of the points belonging to the line segment.
: `start_point : tuple`: the starting point of the line.

Returns
: `result : list`: the sorted line segment.
